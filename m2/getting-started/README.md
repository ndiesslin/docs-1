# Getting Started

Skip to:

[Programming with Arduino IDE](/m2/getting-started/arduino.md) - Get setup and run your first sketch on the Macchina M2.

Software & OS - Getting set up with some of the common tools.

Expansion Modules - Customize M2 by adding the things you need.

## What’s in the Box?
Inside your box you should find the following:

- M2 (UTD or UTH)
- 26 pin cable harness kit
- 24 pin cable harness kit (UTH version only)
- Window sticker
- Start up card

## Quick projects:

- Set up Arduino IDE
- Blink an LED
- Simple CAN tutorial
- Simple Communication tutorial

## Enclosures:

It’s ok to do some initial setup before you have an enclosure, but before your M2 spends long periods in the car please consider protecting it. We have a few configurations of enclosures designed and ready for 3D printing. You can download the designs, tweak them as needed, print, share, lather, rinse, repeat.
